# Admin Panel - User Management Guide

## Overview
The Admin Panel is **EXCLUSIVELY** available to System Administrators only. No other roles, including HR Managers, have access to the admin panel. This ensures proper separation of administrative duties and enhanced security.

**Access Control:**
- **System Administrator:** Full admin panel access for user management
- **HR Manager:** HR-specific permissions without admin panel access
- **Other Roles:** No admin panel access

## Access Requirements
- **Role:** System Administrator ONLY
- **Email:** `sysadmin@horizonbankss.com`
- **Password:** `SysAdminSecure2024!`

- **Profile Access:** Restricted (System Admins have no personal profiles)

## Important Security Changes
- **HR Managers** no longer have wildcard (`*`) permissions
- **Admin Panel** is restricted to System Administrators only
- **Profile** navigation moved to the end of the menu
- **Enhanced Access Control** with specific role-based permissions
